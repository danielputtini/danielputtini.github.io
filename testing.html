    <h1>Leveraged Buyout (LBO)</h1>

    <h3>A type of M&A deal where the acquirer uses a great amount of debt (70-75%) to finance an acquisition while using the target's cash flows as collateral</h3>

    <hr>

    <h3>Financial sponsors can profit from an LBO through 3 different effects:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><h3>Deleveraging</h3></li>
        <p>Basically repaying the debt acquired as much as possible and, after a few years, re-selling for the same EBITDA multiple</p>
        <li><h3>Arbitrage</h3></li>
        <p>Betting that the market for the target will be better after a few years and that you will be able to sell it for a higher EBITDA multiple</p>
        <li><h3>Growth</h3></li>
        <p>Very common for Private Equity firms, where they basically get inside managing the firm and try to improve operations, increasing their EBITDA itself. And then selling it</p>
    </ol>
